Having a general [overview of the architecture][dd:architecture], it is time to
really dive in, and see what happens when we use the keyboard! We'll start with
the keyboard booting up, reach the main loop, and follow the events as they
unfold once a key is pressed, held a bit, and released. Brace yourself for an
exciting, yet furious adventure! After me, brave Traveller!
